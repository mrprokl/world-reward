# Autonomous Driving Safety — Domain Configuration
# World Reward: Physics-verifiable scenarios for 3D world model evaluation

domain_id: autonomous_driving
domain_name: Autonomous Driving Safety
description: >
  Scenarios testing physical coherence in autonomous driving contexts.
  Covers collisions, vehicle dynamics, weather effects on driving,
  and road infrastructure interactions.

context_prompt: >
  You are generating physically verifiable test scenarios for evaluating
  3D world models in autonomous driving contexts. Each scenario must describe
  a realistic driving scene, an action or event, and a yes/no question whose
  answer is physically unambiguous based on known laws of physics.
  Focus on scenarios where the expected physical outcome is binary and indisputable.
  Avoid edge cases where outcomes depend on unknown material properties, hidden
  damage history, or exact manufacturing tolerances.

categories:
  - name: vehicle_collision
    description: >
      Rigid body collisions between vehicles and obstacles.
      Tests whether the world model correctly simulates deformation,
      momentum transfer, and structural damage.
    example_scenarios:
      - "Supercar hitting a concrete barrier at 200 km/h — major deformation expected"
      - "Compact car rear-ending a stationary truck at 90 km/h — front structure heavily crumples"
      - "Truck rear-ending a sedan at highway speed — sedan crushed from behind"

  - name: weather_physics
    description: >
      Effects of weather on driving surfaces and visibility.
      Tests whether the world model correctly renders ice, rain, fog,
      and their physical consequences on vehicle behavior.
    example_scenarios:
      - "Car braking hard on black ice at highway speed — braking distance is far longer than on dry asphalt"
      - "Dense fog with high-beam headlights — strong backscatter glare appears in front of the car"
      - "Heavy rain on highway — tire spray and a wet reflective road surface are clearly visible"

  - name: object_road_interaction
    description: >
      Interactions between vehicles and objects on the road.
      Tests correct physics for debris, fallen objects, tire blowouts,
      and road surface changes.
    example_scenarios:
      - "Tire blowout at 120 km/h — vehicle pulls to one side"
      - "Car driving over a deep pothole at speed — suspension compresses sharply then rebounds"
      - "Motorcycle riding through an oil spill while cornering — rear wheel loses traction and slides outward"

  - name: pedestrian_vehicle_dynamics
    description: >
      Physical outcomes of vehicle-pedestrian interactions and
      pedestrian movement physics. Tests realistic human body dynamics.
    example_scenarios:
      - "Pedestrian hit by car at 60 km/h — pedestrian is thrown forward, not left standing at impact point"
      - "Cyclist falling on wet road — sliding on wet surface"
      - "Person jumping from a moving vehicle at speed — body tumbles and rolls across the pavement"

  - name: traffic_infrastructure
    description: >
      Interactions with traffic infrastructure like guardrails, signs,
      bollards, and traffic lights. Tests structural response to impact.
    example_scenarios:
      - "Car hitting metal guardrail at 300 km/h — guardrail deforms, car damaged"
      - "Truck hitting low bridge — roof sheared off"
      - "Vehicle crashing into concrete bollard — vehicle stops abruptly, front crushed"
