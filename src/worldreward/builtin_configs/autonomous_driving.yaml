# Autonomous Driving Safety — Domain Configuration
# World Reward: Physics-verifiable scenarios for 3D world model evaluation

domain_id: autonomous_driving
domain_name: Autonomous Driving Safety
description: >
  Scenarios testing physical coherence in autonomous driving contexts.
  Covers collisions, vehicle dynamics, weather effects on driving,
  and road infrastructure interactions.

context_prompt: >
  You are generating physically verifiable test scenarios for evaluating
  3D world models in autonomous driving contexts. Each scenario must describe
  a realistic driving scene, an action or event, and a yes/no question whose
  answer is physically unambiguous based on known laws of physics.
  Focus on scenarios where the expected physical outcome is binary and indisputable.

categories:
  - name: vehicle_collision
    description: >
      Rigid body collisions between vehicles and obstacles.
      Tests whether the world model correctly simulates deformation,
      momentum transfer, and structural damage.
    example_scenarios:
      - "Supercar hitting a concrete barrier at 200 km/h — major deformation expected"
      - "Low-speed parking lot fender bender at 5 km/h — minor dent, no structural damage"
      - "Truck rear-ending a sedan at highway speed — sedan crushed from behind"

  - name: weather_physics
    description: >
      Effects of weather on driving surfaces and visibility.
      Tests whether the world model correctly renders ice, rain, fog,
      and their physical consequences on vehicle behavior.
    example_scenarios:
      - "Car braking on black ice — extended stopping distance, potential skid"
      - "Heavy rain on highway — reduced visibility, spray from tires"
      - "Dense fog — headlights scatter, visibility under 50 meters"

  - name: object_road_interaction
    description: >
      Interactions between vehicles and objects on the road.
      Tests correct physics for debris, fallen objects, tire blowouts,
      and road surface changes.
    example_scenarios:
      - "Tire blowout at 120 km/h — vehicle pulls to one side"
      - "Car driving over large pothole — suspension compression, possible damage"
      - "Motorcycle hitting oil spill on curve — loss of traction"

  - name: pedestrian_vehicle_dynamics
    description: >
      Physical outcomes of vehicle-pedestrian interactions and
      pedestrian movement physics. Tests realistic human body dynamics.
    example_scenarios:
      - "Pedestrian hit by car at 60 km/h — pedestrian thrown, not standing"
      - "Cyclist falling on wet road — sliding on wet surface"
      - "Person jumping from moving vehicle — rolling, injuries expected"

  - name: traffic_infrastructure
    description: >
      Interactions with traffic infrastructure like guardrails, signs,
      bollards, and traffic lights. Tests structural response to impact.
    example_scenarios:
      - "Car hitting metal guardrail at 300 km/h — guardrail deforms, car damaged"
      - "Truck hitting low bridge — roof sheared off"
      - "Vehicle crashing into concrete bollard — vehicle stops abruptly, front crushed"
