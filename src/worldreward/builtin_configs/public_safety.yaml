# Public Safety & Infrastructure — Domain Configuration
# World Reward: Physics-verifiable scenarios for 3D world model evaluation

domain_id: public_safety
domain_name: Public Safety & Infrastructure
description: >
  Scenarios testing physical coherence in public safety and urban
  infrastructure contexts. Covers structural failures, natural disasters,
  fire dynamics, and material behavior under stress.

context_prompt: >
  You are generating physically verifiable test scenarios for evaluating
  3D world models in public safety and urban infrastructure contexts.
  Each scenario must describe a realistic urban or natural scene, an action
  or event, and a yes/no question whose answer is physically unambiguous
  based on known laws of physics. Focus on scenarios relevant to emergency
  response, structural safety, and natural disaster simulation.

categories:
  - name: structural_failure
    description: >
      Building and infrastructure collapse, material fatigue,
      and structural load limits. Tests whether the world model
      correctly simulates structural integrity and failure modes.
    example_scenarios:
      - "Overloaded bridge beyond capacity — visible deformation and collapse"
      - "Earthquake shaking unreinforced masonry building — walls crack and crumble"
      - "Crane dropping heavy load on glass roof — roof shatters"

  - name: fire_dynamics
    description: >
      Fire spread, smoke behavior, and thermal effects on materials.
      Tests whether the world model correctly simulates combustion,
      heat transfer, and material response to fire.
    example_scenarios:
      - "Wooden building on fire — fire spreads upward, smoke rises"
      - "Gas explosion in enclosed space — blast wave, windows blown out"
      - "Metal beam exposed to intense fire — beam sags and deforms"

  - name: water_and_flooding
    description: >
      Flood dynamics, water flow, buoyancy, and water damage.
      Tests correct fluid simulation in urban environments.
    example_scenarios:
      - "Flash flood in narrow street — cars swept away by current"
      - "Rising water level around wooden fence — fence eventually gives way"
      - "Heavy object dropped in deep water — sinks to bottom"

  - name: gravity_and_falling
    description: >
      Objects and structures falling under gravity. Tests correct
      simulation of freefall, impact, and resulting damage.
    example_scenarios:
      - "Construction debris falling from 10th floor — accelerates, smashes on impact"
      - "Person falling from height onto concrete — does not walk away uninjured"
      - "Tree falling on parked car — roof crushed, windshield shattered"

  - name: material_behavior
    description: >
      How materials respond to force, temperature, and environmental
      conditions. Tests glass shattering, metal bending, ice melting, etc.
    example_scenarios:
      - "Glass window hit by rock — glass shatters"
      - "Ice sculpture in direct sunlight at 35°C — melts over time"
      - "Rubber tire run over by heavy machinery — deforms but does not shatter"
