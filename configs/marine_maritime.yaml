# Marine & Maritime Physics — Domain Configuration
# World Reward: Physics-verifiable scenarios for 3D world model evaluation

domain_id: marine_maritime
domain_name: Marine & Maritime Physics
description: >
  Scenarios testing physical coherence in marine and maritime contexts.
  Covers buoyancy, hydrodynamics, wave interactions, vessel collisions,
  cargo loading physics, and weather effects at sea.

context_prompt: >
  You are generating physically verifiable test scenarios for evaluating
  3D world models in marine and maritime contexts. Each scenario must describe
  a realistic sea, ocean, or waterway scene, an action or event, and a yes/no
  question whose answer is physically unambiguous based on known laws of physics
  (buoyancy, fluid dynamics, Archimedes' principle, wave mechanics).
  Focus on scenarios where the expected physical outcome is binary and indisputable.

categories:
  - name: buoyancy_and_displacement
    description: >
      Objects sinking or floating based on density and Archimedes' principle.
      Tests whether the world model correctly simulates buoyancy, waterline
      displacement, and density-based outcomes.
    example_scenarios:
      - "Solid steel cube dropped into ocean — sinks to the bottom"
      - "Empty sealed wooden barrel pushed underwater and released — rises back to surface"
      - "Overloaded small boat taking on water — eventually sinks below waterline"

  - name: wave_and_current_forces
    description: >
      Effects of waves, tides, and currents on vessels and floating objects.
      Tests whether the world model correctly simulates hydrodynamic forces,
      drift, and wave-object interactions.
    example_scenarios:
      - "Small rowboat hit by large ocean wave broadside — capsizes"
      - "Floating debris carried by strong river current toward bridge pylon — collides with pylon"
      - "Anchored buoy in heavy swell — bobs up and down but stays in place"

  - name: vessel_collision_and_damage
    description: >
      Collisions between vessels and obstacles such as rocks, icebergs,
      or other ships. Tests correct simulation of impact damage, hull
      breach, and structural deformation.
    example_scenarios:
      - "Cargo ship striking an iceberg at cruising speed — hull breach, water ingress"
      - "Two motorboats colliding head-on at high speed — fiberglass hulls shatter on impact"
      - "Sailboat running aground on rocky reef — hull torn open at the bottom"

  - name: cargo_and_loading_physics
    description: >
      Effects of cargo distribution, overloading, and shifting weight
      on vessel stability. Tests correct simulation of center of gravity,
      listing, and capsizing.
    example_scenarios:
      - "Container ship with all cargo stacked on one side — vessel lists heavily to that side"
      - "Fishing boat loaded far beyond capacity — gunwale dips below waterline, takes on water"
      - "Cargo shifting suddenly during sharp turn — vessel rolls dangerously"

  - name: weather_at_sea
    description: >
      Effects of storms, wind, ice, and extreme weather on maritime
      vessels and structures. Tests correct simulation of wind forces,
      ice accumulation, and storm surge.
    example_scenarios:
      - "Sailboat caught in hurricane-force winds — mast snaps under wind load"
      - "Ice accumulating on fishing trawler superstructure — vessel becomes top-heavy, stability compromised"
      - "Lightning striking metal mast of a yacht — electrical discharge through the mast, no fire on metal"
